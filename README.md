This paper uses spacings of adjacent eigenvalues (Ps) to characterize cancer gene networks. 
-- P(s) is found to follow Wigner distribution (eigenvalues are correlated and repel each other) when network is dense (many edges).
-- P(s) is Poisson distributed when gene network is sparse (small number of edges, eigenvalues are independent)
